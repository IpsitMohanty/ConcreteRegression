# **ConcreteStrengthPredictor**

## **Overview**
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete samples based on the volumes of its key ingredients, such as cement, water, fly ash, and others. The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and consists of 1030 samples.

Using regression techniques, this project explores the relationship between ingredient proportions and the compressive strength of concrete, showcasing the application of deep learning and data preprocessing for predictive analytics.
